# fractol

## Objective
Now that you took over your first graphical library: the miniLibX (FdF), itâ€™s time for you to light all the pixels of your screen at the same time!

This new project will be the opporunity for you to hone your miniLibX skills, to make you discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.

## Execution

FdF's minilibx requires you to be on MacOSX

```sh
$ make
$ ./fractol julia/mandelbrot
```
